# Development Guide

This guide covers setting up a local development environment for contributing to Blend itself.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker Desktop
- VS Code with Dev Containers extension

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the [blend-app repository](https://github.com/andrew-rubio/blend-app)
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/blend-app.git
   cd blend-app
   ```
3. Open in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
4. When prompted, click **Reopen in Container**

The Dev Container will build and install all required tools automatically.

## Working with Agents

Agent definitions live in `.github/agents/*.agent.md`. Each file contains:

- YAML front matter with `name`, `model`, and `tools`
- Markdown body with detailed agent instructions

When modifying agent instructions, test your changes by invoking the agent in Copilot Chat.

## Working with Prompts

Prompt files live in `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md`. These are the workflow entry points invoked with `/prompt-name` in Copilot Chat.

## Running the Documentation Site Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to preview the documentation.

To check for broken links and other issues:

```bash
mkdocs build --strict
```

## Code Style

- Follow the standards defined in `AGENTS.md` (generated by `apm install`)
- Python: PEP 8
- TypeScript/JavaScript: ESLint with project config
- Markdown: 120 character line limit

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`
2. Make your changes
3. Commit with a descriptive message following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
4. Open a Pull Request against `main`

## Running Tests

```bash
# Documentation build test
mkdocs build --strict
```
